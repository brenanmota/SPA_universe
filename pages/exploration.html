    <p>Celestial bodies and stars have always been a source of great fascination for humanity. There are
      Greek, Mesopotamian, and Aztec records describing various celestial events. In the contemporary era, several
      scientists have made great contributions so that the dream of exploring space could become a reality, such as the
      Russian Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, the German Hermann Oberth and the American Robert Goddard.
